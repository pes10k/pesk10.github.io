    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you’ll build on and improve the sentence parsing example
from class.  You’ll need to write code that’ll parse a text into a series
of sentences.  You’ll find that this is surprisingly difficult, for a variety
of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In English, you can “nest” sentences, with quotation marks.  For example,
the sentence ‘Pete said, “Parsing sentences is difficult.  Good luck!”
to the class, with a sinister grimace.’ should be treated as one sentence,
not three.</li>
  <li>English overloads period, both as a sentence terminator, and for denoting
abbreviations.  For example, “Pete is flattered to be mistakenly called
professor, even though he doesn’t have a Ph.D.” is one sentence, not two.</li>
  <li>Sometimes, sentence terminators are not really used as terminators.  For
example, ‘Please read this so called “e-text.”’ is one sentence, even
though it doesn’t end with a period.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll find that there is no easy, obvious, general solution to this problem,
and you’ll need to rely on a variety of heuristics and rough approaches.  As
a result, you’ll need to make sure that improving your solution in some new
manner does not in turn break some other case you previously handled correctly.</p>

<p>This makes the problem a good target for test-driven-development, or
building the “success conditions” for your code first, and then building code
that successfully meets those conditions.</p>

<p>In this case, you’ll be using <a href="http://junit.org/junit4/">jUnit</a> to build unit
tests, each of which should present some new challenge in parsing a text
into sentences.  Your repo already includes one test case in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">tests/SentenceParserTest.java</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SentenceParserTest#toSentencesExample1Test</code>
method.</p>

<p>You have to tasks in this assignment.  <strong>First</strong>, you should create <em>at least</em>
10 more test cases, each posing some different challenging test case in
sentence parsing.  Each test you implement should embody some new
difficulty in parsing a text into sentences (and the accompanying javadoc
docblock should explain the difficulty the test is testing for).</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, you should implement a solution for parsing a text into sentences
in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">edu.uic.cs342.SentenceParser#asList</code> method.  You should improve your
solution by making it pass as many of your tests as possible.  Your solution
will not be evaluated based on how may of <em>your</em> tests your solution passes
(it’ll be evaluated based on how many TA-created tests your solution passes).
But by passing your own well created tests, you maximize your chances of passing
the TA-created tests.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Your code should meet all of the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must create 10 new test cases, each embodying some difficulty in
sentence parsing, and each test case documented to explain <em>what</em> difficulty
the test case is meant to demonstrate.</li>
  <li>Your code should correctly handle all errors.  Your code <em>must not</em> ever
exit, or print anything to STDOUT or STDERR. Doing so is inappropriate
for library code.  All output or exiting must be handled by the code
calling into your libraries (i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Main.java</code>).  TL;DR, you must handle
error cases by throwing exceptions, not printing debug messages or
exiting.</li>
  <li>Your code must be nicely / readably formatted, following Google’s Java
style (not that Google’s format is <em>best</em>, but that its well documented
and at least <em>good</em>, certainly way better than no standard).</li>
  <li>Your code must be correctly documented.  All methods, properties, and
classes must be documented following “javadoc” conventions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="resources-and-suggestions">Resources and Suggestions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html">Regular Expressions in Java</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, as a place to find a large
number of texts to possibly use as new test cases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Getting-started">jUnit 4</a> guide for
using jUnit for unit testing.</li>
  <li><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Google Java Style Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Your repo also includes a helper <code class="highlighter-rouge">./sentparse</code> tool, which you can use
to more conveniently interact with your program.  Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">./sentparse --help</code>
will provide more information about how to use the program and pass filter /
sorting / output options.</p>

<p>You can run a text through your <code class="highlighter-rouge">SentenceParser#asList</code> method in two ways,
either by providing a path to using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">./sentparse --path &lt;SOME FILE&gt;</code>, or
by passing the text to your program through <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDIN</code>, such as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">cat &lt;SOME FILE&gt; | ./sentparse</code>.</p>

<p>You can also use the included <code class="highlighter-rouge">makefile</code> to conveniently perform some common
tasks with your code.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">make clean</code> will clear out your previously built <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.class</code> files</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">make build</code> will build your java project</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">make cases</code> will build your project, and then run all the jUnit test cases.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">make check</code> will check that your code is meeting the required coding
standards.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>There are a maximum of 36 points possible on this assignment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3 Points</strong>:  Correctly formatting your code (ie passing <code class="highlighter-rouge">make check</code> with
               no errors).</li>
  <li><strong>3 Points</strong>:  Correctly documenting your code (i.e. all classes, methods
               properties having correct docblocks).</li>
  <li><strong>20 Points</strong>: Correctly creating 10 unit tests cases, each correctly
               documented, and each testing a different aspect of sentence
               parsing.</li>
  <li><strong>10 Points</strong>: Correctly pass 5 TA-provided test cases, of splitting
               a text into sentences.</li>
</ul>

<p>This assignment is due by 11:59AM on Monday, July 17, 2017.</p>
