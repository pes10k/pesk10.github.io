Attendance
---
There will
be a large discussion component to the course, and I'll call on
names from the roster at random to start discussion.  If your name
is called and you're not in class, you'll loose participation points
for the day.  There will also be a short quiz at the beginning of
each class about the readings for the day.  You will need to
be in class each day to take this quiz to receive points.

Programming
---
About the 1/2 the course will be learning Java and how to use it well.
The remaining part of the class will be about software design aspects
that are not specific to Java. I expect there will be homework
assignments once or twice a week.

Discussion
---
There will be lots of discussion, both in small groups and as an entire class.
This will be part of the course grade. I will be calling on people randomly to
discuss, so everyone will need to talk at times, and come to class prepared to
do so. If you have language or other circumstances that will make this difficult,
please let me know *in advance* and we'll work something out.

Academic Honesty
---
I take this very seriously. I will work very hard to catch people cheating on
assignments and exams, and will do as much as I can to punish anyone acting
dishonestly. This includes sharing work beyond what is allowed, cheating on
exams, etc. Really, truly, don't try it.

Grade Determination
---

Grading will follow the following formula (subject to change):

Percent of grade | Portion of class
---              | ---
10               | class participation
10               | reading quizzes
30               | homework
20               | midterm
30               | final
